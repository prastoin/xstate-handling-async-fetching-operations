# Handling async operations with XState

This repo illustrates the following [article](http://paul.rastoin.dev/writing/posts/xstate-handling-async-operations).
It contains a working and tested `Vue3` + `XState` implementation of XState `promises invocations` and `parallel states` usage, in this case by fetching several content at the same time.
It's tested using `@xstate/test` and `Cypress` within e2e tests.
